This is the client-side software for OBS.ninja.  Feel free to use it as you will; code suggestions welcomed, although you may be best suited at getting ahold of me at steve@seguin.email

OBS.ninja uses peer 2 peer technology, so the server-side load is very small for most applications.

The Server-side software is hosted by my other project, https://Steves.app and https://meshcast.io  I have not made the server side software public yet, but it remains free to access and use.



Idea, feed back, bugs, etc -- all welcomed

License? Well, currently it is free to use and modify however you wish. Please link back here if redistributing.  I reserve the right with release future versions that may not be free or may have a difference liceence agreement. I cannot be held responsible for what you do with my software and if my server goes down, I will not be responsible for that either.
