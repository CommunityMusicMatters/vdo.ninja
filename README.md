## What's in this repo?

This is the client-side software for OBS.ninja.  Feel free to use it as you will; code suggestions welcomed, although you may be best suited at getting ahold of me at steve@seguin.email

## HOW TO DEPLOY

To use, just download and host on a HTTPS-enabled webserver. You may want to hide the .html extensions within your HTTP server as well. Customize as desired. Poke me at steve@seguin.email if you wish to commit your changes to obs.ninja directly.

## What is OBS NINJA
OBS.ninja uses peer 2 peer technology, so the server-side load is very small for most applications.


## Server side / API software?

The Server-side software is hosted by my other project, https://Steves.app and https://meshcast.io  I have not made the server side software public yet, but it remains free to access and use.

Idea, feed back, bugs, etc -- all welcomed

## License

I cannot be held responsible for what you do with my software and if my server goes down, I will not be responsible for that either.
