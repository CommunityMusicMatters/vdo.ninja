## What's in this repo?

This is the client-side software for OBS.ninja.  Feel free to use it as you will; code contributions very welcomed. You may be best suited at getting ahold of me at steve@seguin.email instead of via Github if urgent though.

## HOW TO DEPLOY

To use, just download and host on a HTTPS-enabled webserver. You may want to hide the .html extensions within your HTTP server as well. Customize as desired. Poke me at steve@seguin.email if you wish to commit your changes to obs.ninja directly.

## What is OBS NINJA
OBS.ninja uses peer 2 peer technology, so the server-side load is very small for most applications.

## Server side / API software?

The Server-side software uses code from my other project, https://Steves.app and https://meshcast.io  I have not made the server side software public yet, but the API remains free to access and use. If it gets abused, I'll put up restrictions. I do my best to not collect data of any type, but I may do so to improve the service, such as monitoring site usage, logging errors, or ensuring reliable connectivity.

Idea, feed back, bugs, etc -- all welcomed.  I'm dumping many of my ideas as issues into Github.

## License 

License? Well, currently it is free to use and modify however you wish. Please link back here if redistributing.  I reserve the right to  release future versions that may not be free or may have a different liceence agreement. I cannot be held responsible for what you do with my software and if my server goes down, I will not be responsible for that either.
